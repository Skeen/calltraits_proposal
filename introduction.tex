Compile-time reflection capabilities are one of the cornerstones of C++ template
meta-programming. TR1 brought us the \verb|<type_traits>| header, and thereby
provided us with a way to query information about types, and their relationships.

This proposal aims to add support for compile-time retrieval of return-type,
arity, parameter types, and such for various callable types; e.g. function
pointers (free, static, and non-static), functors and lambdas. In general
everything implementing the call operator.

That is a way to query information about callable types.

The proposed interface is inspired from the \verb|<type_traits>| header, a
listing of the proposed traits can be found in the technical specification.

A simple usage example can be found in the motivation section.
