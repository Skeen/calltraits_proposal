This proposal aims to add support for compile-time retrieval of return-type,
arity, parameter types, and such for various callable types; e.g. function
pointers (free, static, and non-static), functors and lambdas. In general
everything implementing the call operator.

The proposed interface is a trait inspired one, a listing of the proposed
traits can be found in the technical specification.

A simple usage example can be found in the motivation section.
