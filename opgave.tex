\section{Scope}
The people who'll likely be the users of this proposed extension to the standard
library, are generally speaking library writers and other generic code developers.

Who are experienced C++ developers.

\section{Impact On the Standard}
This proposal can be implemented as a pure library extension, but it may be
compiler supported as the implementation is left as a detail, and compiler and
standard library vendors are free to implement the traits interface in any
way they see fit.

The proposal does not require changes to any standard classes, functions or headers.
It does however introduce a new header, namely \verb|call_traits|.

\section{Design Decisions}
The interface design is chosen to match the \verb|type_traits| library. As for
naming, nothing is settled yet, as this is still a discussion paper.
